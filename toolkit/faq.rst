How do I install the NVIDIA driver?
-----------------------------------

| The recommended way is to use your `package manager`_ and install the
  ``cuda-drivers`` package (or equivalent).
| When no packages are available, you should use an official
  `runfile`_.

| Alternatively, and as a technology preview, the NVIDIA driver can be
  deployed through a container.
| Refer to the `documentation`_ for more information.

Iâ€™m getting ``The following signatures were invalid: EXPKEYSIG`` while trying to install the packages, what do I do?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Make sure you fetched the latest GPG key from the repositories. Refer to
the `repository instructions`_ for your distribution.
